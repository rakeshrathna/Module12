# ðŸŒ€ Queue using Linked List - Insert, Display, and Delete

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that:
- Inserts elements into a queue.
- Displays all inserted elements.
- Deletes the first element.
- Displays the updated queue after deletion.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. **Create a Queue**:
   - Initialize an empty list named `queue`.

2. **Insert Elements**:
   - Use the `append()` method to insert elements `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` into the queue.

3. **Display Initial Queue**:
   - Print the message `"Queue after elements are inserted:"` followed by the queue contents.

4. **Delete First Element**:
   - Use `pop(0)` to remove the first inserted element (FIFO - First In First Out).
   - Print the message `"Deleting the first element inserted:"` and the element removed.

5. **Display Updated Queue**:
   - Print the message `"Queue after the first element is deleted:"` followed by the updated queue contents.

## Program
```
  queue = []
  queue.append('a')
  queue.append('b')
  queue.append('c')
  print('Queue after elements are inserted:')
  print(queue)
  print('Deleting the first element inserted:')
  print(queue.pop(0))
  print('Queue after the first elements is deleted:')
  print(queue)
```

## Output

![445572522-564cf71b-6351-41aa-afb3-c9ff8025aa09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43e0673b-9a1f-4950-aa9e-a61f970a30f3)

## Result
Thus, the program is executed successfully
